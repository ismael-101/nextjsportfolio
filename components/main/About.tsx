                Hello, I'm Ismael, a dedicated web developer. My coding journey
                began in 2019 through online courses and tutorials, and my
                thirst for knowledge led me to pursue a one-year program in
                programming for full-stack development from 2023 to 2024.
              </p>
              <p className="my-3 lg:my-5">
                From day one, my passion for coding has been unyielding,
                evolving into a genuine obsession. It's like a drug to me; the
                more I learn, the more I crave. Organization is my forte, both
                in code and in life. Beyond coding, you'll find me immersed in
                another loveâ€”swimming.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-3 lg:mb-6">
                Currently, I'm enrolled in courses on the Coursera platform,
                learning from some of the industry's top web developers. My
                focus is on honing my skills in JavaScript and React. I've also
                taken on the challenge of daily algorithm exercises on various
                web platforms. I'll be sharing my rankings soon, providing a
                glimpse into my dedication to continuous improvement.
