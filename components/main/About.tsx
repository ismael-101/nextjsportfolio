  began in 2019 through online courses and tutorials, and my
  thirst for knowledge led me to pursue a one-year program in
  programming for full-stack development from 2023 to 2024.`;
  const second = ` From day one, my passion for coding has been unyielding,
  evolving into a genuine obsession. It's like a drug to me; the
  more I learn, the more I crave. Organization is my forte, both
  in code and in life. Beyond coding, you'll find me immersed in
  another loveâ€”coding.`;
  const third = ` Currently, I'm enrolled in courses on the Coursera platform,
  learning from some of the industry's top web developers. My
  focus is on honing my skills in JavaScript and React. I've also
  taken on the challenge of daily algorithm exercises on various
  web platforms. I'll be sharing my rankings soon, providing a
  glimpse into my dedication to continuous improvement.`;

  something extraordinary!`;
